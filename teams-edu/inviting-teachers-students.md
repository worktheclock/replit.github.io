# Inviting teachers and students


To invite people with their Replit username or email address, follow the steps during [team creation](/teams-edu/intro-teams-education). 

## Invite Org Owners and Admins (Teachers)
**Org Owners** can add and remove Org Admins, delete and rename an org, and create and access all teams as an admin. 

**Org Admins** can create new teams within an organization.

* To add a new Org Admin or Owner, find your Organization and click on the settings gear.
* Click "Add Org Admin or Owner"
* Invite an Org Admin or Owner using their username or email. They'll receive a notification to join your team with their new role!

## Invite Team Admins
**Team Admins** can view and edit Team Projects, Project Solutions, and student submissions.

* To add someone as a Team Admin, first add them to your team as you would a student.
* Once they've accepted the invite, go to the "Manage Team Members" modal and change their role to "Admin"

1. Go to your team, click "Add more" and click "Generate a team invite link".
2. Check the box next to "Do not collect names/emails".
