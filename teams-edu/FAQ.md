##### How do I manage team members in a team?

You can [invite teachers and students](https://docs.replit.com/teams/inviting-teachers-students) to a team. Additionally, you can [change user roles](https://docs.replit.com/teams/assigning-user-roles) for teachers in order for them to have admin access to the subscription to create their own teams, create projects, etc.

##### How do I create a team project?

[Team Projects](https://docs.replit.com/teams/creating-projects-assignments) are projects and assignments that teachers can set up with starter code, instructions, and materials for their students. When starting a Team Project, students duplicate their own, private versions of the Team Projects to edit and customize freely.


##### How do I auto-grade projects?

One option is [input/output testing](https://docs.replit.com/teams/input-output-testing) which allows a teacher to create simple tests that automatically match input values to expected output in student projects. Teachers can also create [unit tests](https://docs.replit.com/teams/unit-testing) which allows a repl author to create code-driven tests that compare actual function output with expected output.
