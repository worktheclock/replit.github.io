# Testing, assessments, and autograding

Replit has a number of features related to helping teachers automatically grade students' assignments.

The simplest of these is [Input/Output testing](./InputOutput), which allows you to check that your student's homework produces specific outputs, matching exact strings or regexes.

A step above this is [Unit Testing](/repls/UnitTesting), which allows you to write full unit tests in Java (JUnit), Python (unittest), or JavaScript (Jest).
