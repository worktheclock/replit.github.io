# Lesson and Instructions Authoring

Teachers may create read-only instructions for their students to follow as well as admin-only lesson plans to keep as notes and share curriculum with their peers using the Curriculum Authoring tool in their Team Project file tree. 

Instructions and Lesson Plan files are written in markdown. You can find a handy guide to markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!

### Instructions
Instructions are view-only documents meant to provide guidance for students as they work on their projects. They are editable by Team admins in the `instructions.md` file. 

Students will see the instructions in the pane next to their text editor.

### Lesson Plans
Lesson Plans are accessible only to admins in the `lessonplan.md` file. They are meant to provide speaker notes for individual teachers or guidance for teachers who may share curriculum with their peers or in the Curriculum Hub.

*Do not place project solutions in the Lesson Plan.*

### Assets
The Assets folder contains images and other files to be used in the Instructions and Lesson Plans. 

You can embed images from your Assets folder into your curriculum files like so:
