# Introduction to Repls

The name REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop - an interactive, typically console-based, programming environment. However, repls at Repl.it have exceeded that definition and are now capable of much more.

A repl at Repl.it is an interactive programming environment.  You can create a workspace
in any number of [languages](https://repl.it/languages), where you are given a container on a virtual machine where your code can run. In any given repl, there are two main parts - the editor and the console.

The editor uses [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/),
the same technology that powers Visual Studio Code ([learn some tips and tricks](/repls/editor)).  On mobile, the editor is [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/).

The console is where the standard output will appear, and where you will be prompted to
enter standard input.  In most languages, the console doubles as an interactive prompt - you can evaluate
snippets of code interactively, and in [some cases](/repls/files), you can interact with
variables that have been defined in your main body of code.

To get up and running quickly head to the [quick start guide](/misc/quick-start) or read on to learn what you can do with repls.
