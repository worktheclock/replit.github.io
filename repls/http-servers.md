# Deploying HTTP Servers

For deploying HTTP servers, we provide templates for Ruby on Rails, Django, Node
(Express), and Sinatra, but any framework can be used so long as the package can
be imported or the port can be opened.

## Deploying an HTTP Server

To deploy an HTTP server on Repl.it, simply write the code that imports the required
libraries or frameworks and begin listening on a port.  As your server starts up, as
soon as the repl begins listening on a port, a new pane should appear in your editor
with the URL to your web app, along with a preview of the app.

Once deployed, the server will continue to run in the background, even after you close
the browser tab.  The server will stay awake and active until an hour after its last 
request, after which it will enter a sleeping stage.  Sleeping repls will be woken up
as soon as it receives another request; there is no need to re-run the repl.  However,
if you make changes to your server, you will need to restart the repl in order to see
those changes reflected in the live version.

Below is an example of a simple HTTP server running Flask in python3, displaying HTML from `templates/index.html`. Feel free to fork and play with the code as you'd like.

Our [package manager](https://github.com/replit/upm) will handle dependency files automatically in your repls.  See our
documentation on [packages](/repls/packages) for more information on how to install and manage dependencies.

Private keys to external services or APIs can be kept in an `.env` file.
See our documentation on [secret keys](/repls/secret-keys).

If you are using Django and you need access to specific bash commands to
configure the server, please see
[this Django template](https://repl.it/@masfrost/Django-Boilerplate).

## Persistence and Takedown Requests

Note that a repl's public link will persist, even after the repl has been deleted.
You can clear a repl of its server code before deleting it in order to prevent it
from loading.  If you require your web app to be taken down, please contact us at
[contact@repl.it](mailto:contact@repl.it).
