# Using Multiplayer with Anonymous Users

Multiplayer can only be used if you're signed into Replit. We are working on some solutions to allow for anonymous multiplayer functionality but, in the meantime, follow these steps if you have an anonymous user who wants to collaborate with you. 

1. Click the "invite" button in your repl.

2. Copy the join link in your repl.

3. Send your collaborator the join link. They'll be redirected to the sign in page below:

4. After they sign in, they'll be redirected to back to your repl as a collaborator!

If you have any feedback, please let us know on our [feedback page](https://repl.it/feedback/).
