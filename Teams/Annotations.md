## Leaving Feedback on Projects Using Annotations

To leave feedback on your students' work, you can use threads. Threads can be added on projects and team repls, and are an easy way to leave comments on a specific word or line of code.

You can add a thread to a repl by left-clicking on the specific line number where you want to leave the comment. This will highlight the line, and a floating "Start thread" button will appear above the line. Left-click on this button.

Alternatively, highlight anywhere on the line of code, and the floating "Start thread" button will appear.

Once you have clicked on that button, a comment box will pop up towards the right of the code. Type in a comment and press the arrow on the right to save it.

The student who created the repl will receive an in-app notification as well as an email with your comment. They'll be able to reply to the comment or modify the code accordingly.

You can also use familiar markdown syntax in threads and chat.

Here's a quick guide:
