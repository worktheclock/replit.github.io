# Teams for Education [BETA]

##### Note that teams for education is currently in beta. If you are interested in getting started, you can [create a team here](https://repl.it/teams).

[Teams for Education](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) is our newest offering for students and teachers. 

Please read our recent [blog post](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) for more details.

In this article, you'll learn how to sign up for a team and some of the core concepts. Teams (and this documentation) is still in Beta, so expect many changes and improvements over the next weeks and months.

## Creating a team

A team is a collection of teachers (with admin privileges) and students. Everything is based around projects, which gives students real-world experience. Each project can have multiple versions (often, one for each student or group), so students can all start from the same point, but extend the base project in different ways.

### Signing up

If you don't already have one, sign up at [repl.it](https://repl.it). Now click on [teams](https://repl.it/teams) in the sidebar on the left and choose the Education plan.
