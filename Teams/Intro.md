# Teams for Education

[Teams for Education](https://repl.it/teams-for-education) adds key workflows for students and teachers on top of all the core Replit features. In this article, you'll learn how to sign up for a team and get started.

## Creating a Team

A team is a collection of teachers (with admin privileges) and students. The platform is based around projects, which give students real-world experience. Each project can have multiple versions (often, one for each student or group), so students can all start from the same point, but extend the base project in different ways.

### Signing up

If you don't already have an account, sign up at [repl.it](https://repl.it). Now click on [Teams](https://repl.it/teams) in the sidebar on the left and choose the "Education" plan.
