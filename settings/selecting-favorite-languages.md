# Selecting your favorite languages

![favorite languages dropdown](/images/misc/favorite-languages-dropdown.png)

On Replit, your favorite languages are a combination of the top three languages you selected as interested in, and the ones you use most often. You can update the languages you're interested in by [clicking here](https://replit.com/~/cli/account/languages?run=1).

If you do not pick at least three languages, the remaining languages will be automatically chosen for you at random. For example, if you only choose two languages, we will randomly select a third for you.
