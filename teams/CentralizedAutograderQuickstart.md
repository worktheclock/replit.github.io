# Building a centralized autograder - quickstart (Python)

This is the shortcut guide to the [full walkthrough on how to set up a centralized autograder](./CentralizedAutograder). Follow that guide to get step by step instructions and explanations about how it works. Follow this guide if you just want to get it up and running.

**Note:** ⚠️ ⚠️ This guide shows you how to set up a basic fully automated homework grader. It is intended as a proof-of-concept to showcase how to build similar projects on top of Replit. **It should not be used as-is in cases where data is important or sensitive. For example, it offers no protection against malicious students who could submit code similar to `import os; os.system("rm -rf /")` to break the server and delete or modify other students' submissions or grades.** Stay tuned for updated guides and sample repls that resolve these issues. ⚠️⚠️

## Creating the grading server
1. Create a new project for the server in your Team account. Make sure that you **do not** publish this project, as it will host students' work.
2. Create a file called `.replit` and add the following code. Then press the `Run` button.

```bash
language = "bash"
run = "wget https://github.com/replit/replit.github.io/raw/master/static/zip-template-repls/replit-autograding-server-python.zip && unzip -o replit-autograding-server-python.zip && rm .replit"
```

## Create the assignment
1. Create another new project in your Team account. This one you will publish to students.
2. Create a file called `.replit` and add the following code. Then press the `Run` button.

```bash
language = "bash"
run = "wget https://github.com/replit/replit.github.io/raw/master/static/zip-template-repls/replit-autograding-assignment-template-python.zip && unzip -o replit-autograding-assignment-template-python.zip && rm .replit"
```
3. Modify the `url` variable in the `submit.py` file to match the one you saw when you ran your server repl.

## Make it your own
Make any other modifications you need based on the assignment you are setting your students.
1. Update the `README.me` in the assignment project to explain the task to your students
2. Update the `main.py` file to give your students some code to start with and show them how to test it.
3. Update the `test_solution.py` file in the server repl to automatically grade the students' code.
