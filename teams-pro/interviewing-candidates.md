# Interviewing Candidates in Guest Mode

You can use Replit to conduct technical interviews. The Teams Pro guest feature lets you pair program with candidates so you can work with them or observe them in real time.

In this tutorial, we'll show you step-by-step how to conduct a technical interview using Teams Pro. Watch the video or read the text below.

## Steps to follow:

We'll cover how to:

- Create a repl
- Invite candidates
- Observe candidates

## 1. Create a repl

To create a repl for an interview, you need to be a team admin. See the documentation [here](/teams-pro/managing-teams) to find out how to create a team with Replit.

Navigate to the "Teams" page. Under "Team Repls", click the "Create team repl" button and the following popup window will appear:

    alt="Creating a repl"
    style="width: 80% !important;"/>

Choose the template language you will be using for the interview and give you repl a name, then click the 'Create repl' button. 

Once the repl has been created, you will be able to add the relevant files required for the interview. In this example, we've put the instructions for the candidate to follow during the interview in the `main.py` file.

## 2. Invite candidates

Once you have written your challenges, invite candidates by clicking on the "Invite" button in the top-right corner of the window.

You can invite candidates by email or by generating a join link to share with them. Candidates will get a notification of the invite. They will need to sign up for a Replit account before they can accept the invitation.

## 3. Observe candidates

Once candidates join the interview, they will be able to access the challenges in the provided files in read and write mode.

You can observe the candidates as they complete the challenges. Click on the round icon next to the "Invite" button to observe the candidate's repl and watch them work on their `main.py` file.

Candidates can also view your IDE in the same way. This lets them see the changes you want them to make or new intructions you want to add.

## 4. Remove candidate access

To remove candidates from interview repls so they cannot access the interview once it is complete, click on the "Invite" button. In the pop-up window, find the candidateâ€™s name or email.

Click on the "X" next to their name and they will be removed from the interview and will no longer be able to access the link.
